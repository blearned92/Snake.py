## General info
This project serves as my second attempt at making a game and my first time using pygame. It is a simple snake game that allows a single player to control a block known as a snake, move in four 2-dimentional directions, collect 'snacks' and grow in size until the player collides with its own body. 
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python (3.10.0)
* Visual Studio Code (1.63)
	
## Setup
Run in a prefered IDE such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
